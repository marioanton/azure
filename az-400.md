Code Quality Issues.
- Maven and PMD. PMD _> PMD is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth.

Models.
- Scrum. product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the Kanban board, or break PBIs and bugs down into tasks on the taskboard.
- Agile. Choose Agile when your team uses Agile planning methods, including Scrum, and tracks development and test activities separately. This process works great if you want to track user stories and (optionally) bugs on the Kanban board,
- CMMI. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.

Checking source code lincesing etc..
- WhiteSource provides WhiteSource Bolt, a lightweight open source security and management solution developed specifically for integration with Azure DevOps and Azure DevOps Server.  Detect when common open source libraries are added to the code base.
- Black Duck helps organizations identify and mitigate open source security, license compliance and code-quality risks across application and container portfolios.
Black Duck Hub and its plugin for Team Foundation Server (TFS) allows you to automatically find and fix open source security vulnerabilities during the build process, so you can proactively manage risk

Triggers
- Release vs Buiild trigger.

During which phase should you use static code analysis? -> Build

State of Configuration for nodes:
1. Upload
2. Compile
3. Onboard
4. Assing the node configuration
5. Check

Nested Template vs Linked Template.
- Nested : To deploy resources to a different resource group in the same subscription, add a nested deployment and include the resourceGroup property. If you don't specify the subscription ID or resource group, the subscription and resource group from the parent template are used. All the resource groups must exist before running the deployment.
