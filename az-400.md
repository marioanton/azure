- Migration from Team Fundation Server.
  - Most recent RTW?
    - It can take up to 2-3 weeks after a new RTW version of Azure DevOps Server is released for import support to come online for that version. It's important to take this into consideration when choosing to upgrade shortly after a new RTW Azure DevOps Server release.
  - Migration can be done:
    - TFS Database Import Service
    - Manually
    - Public Api based service.

- Code review, quality test..
  - Maven and PMD. PMD.  PMD is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth. Maven does qualitiy of code of java apps.
  - Coverage or JaCoCo. Cobertura. How many tests are for the code. Code can be 90% covered.
  - UI Testing - Selenium
  - Quality code - Gradle, SonarCloud is a cloud service offered by SonarSource and based on SonarQube
  - WhiteSource provides WhiteSource Bolt. Detect when common open source libraries are added to the code base. Check licensing.
  - Black Duck helps organizations identify and mitigate open source security, license compliance and code-quality risks across application and container portfolios, automatically find and fix open source security vulnerabilities during the build process, so you can proactively manage risk
  - Graddle?

Models.
- Scrum. product backlog items (PBIs) and bugs on the  board, or break PBIs and bugs down into tasks on the taskboard. Velocity. Scrum master. No CD. No Changes
- Kanban. Continuos deployment, cycle time lead time... No functions. CD. Changes.
- Agile. framework for scrum, kanbna
- CMMI. With this process, you can track requirements, change requests, risks, and reviews.

Integration with Jenkins
- Personal Token for access from jenkins.
- Serfvice connection to consume artifacs from azdo for releasing et.c
- TFS plugin

GIT
- Decentralized
- Enterprise local VM.

SUBV
- Centralized

Release gates
- Gates allow automatic collection of health signals from external services, and then promote the release when all the signals are successful at the same time or stop the deployment on timeout. 
- For:
  - Incident and issues management
  - Approvals outside..
  ....

Triggers
- Release Trigger
- Buiild trigger.
- PR Trigger.
- Stage  Trigger.

Time outs.
- Pre deployment approval timeout
- Gate approval timeout.


- During which phase should you use static code analysis? -> Build
  - Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run.


DSC - AZDO
- State of Configuration for nodes:
  1. Upload
  2. Compile
  3. Onboard
  4. Assing the node configuration
  5. Check

Nested Template vs Linked Template.
- Nested : To deploy resources to a different resource group in the same subscription, add a nested deployment and include the resourceGroup property. If you don't specify the subscription ID or resource group, the subscription and resource group from the parent template are used. All the resource groups must exist before running the deployment.
