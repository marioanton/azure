### webjb ###
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create . supported plattforms
- WebJobs is not yet supported for App Service on Linux.
- Run a program or script in the same instance as a web app, API app, or mobile app.
- If you have source control configured with your application, the Webjobs should be deployed as part of the source control integration
- func vs webjob: Comparision table https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-compare-logic-apps-ms-flow-webjobs#comparison-table
- WebJobs (without the WebJobs SDK) supports C#, Java, JavaScript, Bash, .cmd, .bat, PowerShell, PHP, TypeScript, Python, and more....
- WEbjos with SDK only c#


### cosmos ###

- Separate account for each API.
- Account type prod or non prod.
- Geo redudandancy Enable/disable (not available Serverless)
- Multi region writes enable/disable. (not available Serverless) -> 99.999% high availability
- any region
- schema agnostic, auto index.
- INdex, disabled or consistent, exclusions to indexes.
- Container: An Azure Cosmos container is the unit of scalability both for provisioned throughput and storage. A container is horizontally partitioned and then replicated across multiple regions.
- With Azure Cosmos DB, you can provision throughput at two granularities: Azure Cosmos containers and Azure Cosmos databases
- Dedicate throughput or shared per container.
- Thourghput autoscale
- Throughtput at database is shares across containers.
- Trhuput can be at db, at container or both. When both, container not affected by shared. but node could affect.
- Every database can have multiple containers. (Max 25 shared thruput)

### sql ###

- regions, resource group, same region... and fail over groups . https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/auto-failover-group-configure.
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/auto-failover-group-configure?tabs=azure-portal

If you are using active geo-replication, it is possible to create the secondary database in the same region with the primary, but it does not increase the application's resilience to catastrophic failures. If you are using auto-failover groups, your secondary database is always created in a different region.

Active Geo Replication.
- Any Region, recommended paired.
- Not for Managed Instance.
- Can add secondary to same region
- can user diff RG

Auto Failover Group
- Any Region, recommended paired.
- Can't add secondary to same region.
- Managed instance required Gateway. Not overlapping vnet.
- Azure portal does not support the creation of failover groups across different subscriptions. 
- can user diff RG
