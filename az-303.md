If you are using active geo-replication, it is possible to create the secondary database in the same region with the primary, but it does not increase the application's resilience to catastrophic failures. If you are using auto-failover groups, your secondary database is always created in a different region.

Active Geo Replication.
- Any Region, recommended paired.
- Not for Managed Instance.
- Can add secondary to same region
- can user diff RG

Auto Failover Group
- Any Region, recommended paired.
- Can't add secondary to same region.
- Managed instance required Gateway. Not overlapping vnet.
- Azure portal does not support the creation of failover groups across different subscriptions. 
- can user diff RG
